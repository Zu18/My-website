    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Zukhra. At 34 years old, I find myself in a stage of life filled with excitement, growth, and
        exploration. Alongside me are my amazing 9-year-old daughter and my loving spouse, who bring joy and
        adventure into my world. Together, we navigate the ups and downs of life, supporting each other and creating
        cherished memories.
        Originally I am from Russia. I graduated with honors from a Russian university. That helped me to start my
        career as a consumer loan officer in the largest regional bank. My job was to evaluate loan applications.
        After two years I grew into a team leader of 5 people. Then, I continued my career in a different bank where
        I had a team of 9.

        Four years ago, I made the life-changing decision to move to the UK. Since then, I've been captivated by the
        diverse landscapes and cultures of this country. I've made it a priority to dedicate several weekends each
        month to exploring different corners of the UK. From tranquil natural landscapes to vibrant cityscapes, I
        enjoy each journey and appreciate for the beauty that surrounds me.<br>
        But my journey doesn't end there. I'm on a quest for personal and professional growth. I've set my sights on
        becoming a software developer, immersing myself in the world of programming. Age is merely a number, and I
        firmly believe that it's never too late to pursue your dreams.

                Previously, I worked in a bank. However, when I relocated, I realized that I had to start my
                career from scratch. And I thought why not try something new?
                I found that the QA job is quite similar to follow-up control work that I had in a bank before.
                Moreover, I really loved this part of my job.
                I began learning about quality assurance (QA) as a potential career path. However, during my
                learning journey, I discovered the importance of having a foundation in programming for testers.
                Intrigued by this new aspect, I decided to delve into programming and started learning the basics. I
                did not know that this decision would ignite a passion within me.
                The more I learned about programming, the more I fell in love with it. I became captivated by the
                ability to create something that people can use and benefit from. The idea of contributing to the
                development of applications, websites, and systems that have a real-world impact fascinated me.
